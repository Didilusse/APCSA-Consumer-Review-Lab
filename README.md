# Sentiment Analysis and Review Manipulation in Java

**Project Title:** Sentiment Analysis and Review Manipulation in Java

**Description:**
This Java project implements sentiment analysis and review manipulation functionalities. The project includes methods for calculating sentiment values of words, determining star ratings based on sentiment, and generating fake reviews with randomized adjectives. It utilizes external files for sentiment data and adjective lists. The code is organized into a `Review` class, making it easy to integrate into larger projects or use as a standalone sentiment analysis tool.

**Features:**
- Sentiment analysis using pre-existing sentiment values for words.
- Star rating calculation based on cumulative sentiment of a review.
- Generation of fake reviews with randomized adjectives.
- Reading and processing text from external files.
- Utilization of ArrayLists and HashMaps for efficient data storage and retrieval.

**Usage:**
1. Ensure the required external files (`cleanSentiment.csv`, `positiveAdjectives.txt`, `negativeAdjectives.txt`) are present.
2. Create a `Review` object to access the implemented functionalities.
3. Analyze sentiments, calculate star ratings, and generate fake reviews.

**Note:** 
- This project is part of a lab exercise and serves as a simple yet educational example of sentiment analysis and text manipulation in Java.
